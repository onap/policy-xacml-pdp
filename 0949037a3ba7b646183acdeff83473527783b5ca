      "message": "I do this change because when I am trying this tutorial with different policy versions, they are all build with latest tags. So I always need to rebuild the images again and again when I switch to another versions because I am not sure what\u0027s version this latest tag is based on. In this case, I\u0027d like to add the tag instead of latest when build the tutorial image. It will be much more clear.",
