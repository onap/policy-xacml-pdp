      "message": "@Pam, seems it is not the right way to read in the native policy and convert to PolicyType since my junit test always complains \"failed to convert policy\" which is located at this line. See the logs below:\n\n[Fatal Error] :1:7: The processing instruction target matching \"[xX][mM][lL]\" is not allowed.\n15:56:54.722 [main] ERROR com.att.research.xacml.util.XACMLPolicyScanner - The processing instruction target matching \"[xX][mM][lL]\" is not allowed.\n15:56:54.724 [main] ERROR org.onap.policy.pdp.xacml.xacmltest.TestUtils - Application failed to load policy\norg.onap.policy.pdp.xacml.application.common.XacmlApplicationException: loadPolicy failed\n\n\nI don\u0027t understand what this \"Fatal Error\" actually talks about. The policy is the one I copied from github xacml used for conformance test. Do you have any hint?",

      "message": "Ah ok - this is good to use and should work. But you don\u0027t know ahead of time if the policy is PolicyType or PolicySetType that is returned. However, I see that you are just testing right now with a PolicyType so I\u0027m surprised it is having issues. \n\nI will take a closer look tonight, I have to hit the road.",
