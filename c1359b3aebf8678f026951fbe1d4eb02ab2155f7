      "message": "I see that the doFilter is overriden but could we directly inherit from the javax.servlet.Filter class instead of ifrom XacmlPdpAafFilter?  This is to avoid inheriting from the AAF infrastructure as it is currently disabled and AAF as a whole most likely will be discontinued in future releases.  Nice!",

      "message": "I think it is a reasonable assumption provided that has been disabled for several releases already.   In any case I was under the assumption that it was supported as the common *ServletFactory and HttpServletServer support multiple filters with the APIs, do you think there is a limitation there not working, or perhaps it would be in the RestServer wrapping them?  Ideally, would be good to support multiple filters if it was possible.",
