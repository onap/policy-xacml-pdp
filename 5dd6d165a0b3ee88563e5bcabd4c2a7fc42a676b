      "message": "Not a comment for this review, but I feel it can be simplified this install quite a bit, the Dockerfile together with the tar packaging.  Not sure why POLICY_HOME and POLICY_PDX_HOME are both needed, I think it makes it more complex that it should be, with copying files around that end up duplicated, seems to me for what I read.  We can talk about it at a later point, not a comment for this review.",
